### Benchmark data

The file `data.json` contains the raw data included in our paper, *A ‘moment-conserving’ reformulation of GW theory*.
The JSON has keys corresponding to the CAS numbers of each molecule in the GW100 dataset.
Each entry contains data for HF, ADC(2), AGF2, CCSD, CCSD(T), *GW* levels of theory, including the moment-conserving data between 0 and 5 iterations with and without the diagonal approximation.
