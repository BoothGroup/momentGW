## momentGW

Implementations of the *GW* approximation and associated methods, using moment-conserving solutions to the Dyson equation.

This repository contains the implementation and data for the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0143291) *"A 'moment-conserving' reformulation of GW theory"*.

#### Installation

The `momentGW` package, along with dependencies, can be installed as
```
git clone git@github.com:BoothGroup/momentGW.git
cd momentGW
python -m pip install . --user
```

#### Usage

The `momentGW` classes behave similarly to other post-mean-field method classes in PySCF. The `examples` directory contains examples for each solver.
